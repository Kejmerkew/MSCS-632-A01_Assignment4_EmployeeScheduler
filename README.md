# Employee Scheduler (C# & Rust)

This project implements an **employee scheduling application** in two different programming languages: **C# (.NET)** and **Rust**.  
It demonstrates control structures (conditionals, loops, branching) and basic scheduling logic across paradigms.

---

## üìã Features
- Collects employee names and preferred shifts (morning, afternoon, evening) for each day.
- Enforces scheduling rules:
  - Max **1 shift per day** per employee.
  - Max **5 days per week** per employee.
  - At least **2 employees per shift** per day.
- Resolves conflicts when preferred shifts are unavailable.
- Outputs a **weekly schedule table** with employee assignments.
- Bonus: supports global **shift priority ranking** (e.g., morning > evening > afternoon).

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the C# (.NET) Program

1. Create a new console project:
   ```bash
   dotnet new console -n DotnetEmployeeScheduler
   cd DotnetEmployeeScheduler
   ```
2. Replace the generated Program.cs with the C# code from /dotnet/Program.cs
3. Run program
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
4. Enter employees manually, or use the built-in sample data by typing y.
